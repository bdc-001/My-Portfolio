        excerpt: "How a sheltered kid from the hills, a pandemic, and YouTube became the unlikely recipe for cracking JEE and finding myself at IIT Dhanbad.",
        content: `The mountains of Darjeeling taught me to dream small. Not because they weren't magnificent—they were breathtaking—but because when you grow up surrounded by mist and protective parents, the world beyond feels like a distant myth.

I was that kid. Single child. North Point Darjeeling. A beautiful cage with a view.

## The Sheltered Beginning

Darjeeling wasn't just my home; it was my entire universe. While other kids talked about cities and opportunities, I sketched the same hills I'd seen a thousand times and wrote poetry about clouds that never left.

I didn't know I was sheltered. I just thought the world was... smaller.

Then came Kolkata.

## The City Shock

Frank Anthony Public School, Kolkata. Pure science stream. Biology textbooks piled high because that's what "smart kids" were supposed to study.

But here's the thing: I hated biology. Or rather, I loved math more. While everyone memorized the Krebs cycle, I was solving calculus problems in the margins of my notebook. While they dissected frogs, I dissected equations.

I still sketched. I still wrote poetry. But now I was writing about a city that never slept, about crowds that moved like rivers, about a version of myself I was trying to understand.

## When Everything Stopped

2020. COVID-19.

The world shut down. JEE got postponed. Then postponed again.

Then I got COVID.

Quarantined. Isolated. Watching exam dates come and go from behind a bedroom door. I couldn't take the exam that year - not because I wasn't ready, but because the virus had other plans.

I remember sitting in my room, watching my carefully planned timeline collapse. Everyone had a plan for 2020. Mine was supposed to be: Study -> JEE -> IIT -> Life.

Instead, it became: Wait -> Worry -> Wait Some More.

I took a drop year. Not by choice, but by circumstance. By a virus that didn't care about my dreams.

## The YouTube University

Here's what nobody tells you about taking a drop year: It's terrifying and liberating at the same time.

I couldn't afford expensive coaching. So I turned to YouTube.

Yes, YouTube. The same platform where people watch cat videos became my IIT classroom.

I watched lectures at 1.5x speed. I paused, rewound, and replayed until concepts clicked. I learned that the internet doesn't care about your background - it only cares about your WiFi connection.

Physics from one channel. Chemistry from another. Math from a teacher I'd never meet but who somehow made complex numbers feel... simple.

My parents worried. My relatives asked questions. "YouTube? For JEE?"

I didn't have answers. I just had discipline and a dream that was finally getting bigger than Darjeeling's mist.

## The Numbers That Changed Everything

First attempt: **97 percentile**

Not bad. I felt invincible.

Second attempt: **98.7 percentile**

I stared at the screen. This was it. YouTube worked. I worked.

Then came overconfidence.

I got cocky. Thought I had it figured out. Started slacking on the grind.

Last attempt before Advanced (one month out): **90 percentile**

Panic. Pure, raw panic. I'd gone backward.

Then, the asthma attack hit. Middle of prep. Couldn't breathe. Couldn't focus. Everything I'd built felt like it was collapsing.

Advanced exam day: I walked into that hall with an anti-anxiety pill in my system and a prayer on my lips.

**Result: Rank 8800-something**

Not the AIR 500 story you read in newspapers. Not the "topped from a village" headline. Just a kid from the hills who got COVID, had an asthma attack, studied from YouTube, and somehow - somehow - made it work.

## IIT Dhanbad: Where I Found Myself

Chemical Engineering. B.Tech. Four years that felt like a lifetime.

But here's what they don't tell you about IIT: The degree is just the excuse. The real education is everything else.

### The Product Management Club

I became the Coordinator of the Product Management Club. Not because I knew what product management was (I didn't), but because I wanted to build something from scratch.

We went from zero to something real. Workshops, speaker sessions, a community of students who cared about solving problems, not just passing exams.

That's where I learned: **0 to 1 is harder than 1 to 100. But it's also more fun.**

### The Travels

Four years. Delhi. Himachal. The entire East. I traveled like I was making up for lost time—because I was.

Remember that sheltered kid from Darjeeling? He was gone. In his place was someone who took overnight buses, crashed on friends' couches, and learned that India was bigger and more beautiful than any textbook could capture.

### The Hustle

Internships. Multiple. Each one teaching me something new.

A startup attempt with friends from Black Diamond Consulting. We made some money. We failed to scale. We learned that failure is just expensive education.

NGO donations. Because somewhere along the way, I realized that success without service is just greed in a suit.

### The Seniors and Friends

IIT gave me a degree. But the seniors and friends gave me wisdom.

Late-night conversations about life. Early-morning deadlines. Shared struggles. Shared victories.

They taught me that collaboration beats competition. That asking for help is strength, not weakness. That the best ideas come from the worst chai.

## The PPO That Changed My Path

Final year. Placement season. Chaos.

Convin.ai offered me a Pre-Placement Offer (PPO) as an Associate Product Manager.

I said yes. Not because I knew what I was getting into (again), but because it felt right.

Bangalore. Product management. AI. A chance to build things that matter.

The kid from Darjeeling who once thought the world was small was now moving to one of India's tech hubs to shape products for thousands of users.

## What I'd Tell My Younger Self

**To the boy in Darjeeling:**
The world is bigger than you think. And you're braver than you know.

**To the kid who took a drop year:**
YouTube is underrated. Discipline is underrated. You are underrated.

**To the IIT freshman:**
The degree will get you in the door. But it's the skills, the network, and the hustle that will keep you in the room.

**To anyone reading this:**
Your path doesn't have to be linear. Mine certainly wasn't.

Sheltered kid -> City shock -> Pandemic -> YouTube -> JEE -> IIT -> Startup -> Product Management -> Bangalore

It's messy. It's real. And it's mine.

## The Mountains Still Call

I still visit Darjeeling. The mist is still there. The mountains are still breathtaking.

But now when I look at them, I don't see limits. I see where I started.

And the view from here? It's incredible.`,
